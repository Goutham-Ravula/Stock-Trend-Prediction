## Features

- **Data Acquisition:** The application fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the "yfinance" library. Users can input stock ticker symbols to retrieve relevant data.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualizations include line charts displaying historical stock prices, closing prices, 100-day moving averages, and stock volatility over time. These visualizations help users identify trends and assess risk.

- **Statistical Analysis:** The application performs linear regression analysis on historical data, exploring relationships between opening prices, high prices, low prices, and trading volumes. It calculates the R-squared value to gauge model accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation:** The application evaluates the linear regression model using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and model accuracy. These metrics provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities.
